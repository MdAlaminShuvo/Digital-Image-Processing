1. Introduction

To understand the effect of Fourier Transform we need an image and here is the image I
chose to apply fast Fourier transform.

2.Fourier Transform

In this report, we used Numpy’s built-in function to perform Fourier Transform. At first,
we will FFT2 because an image is a 2D signal. Then centered the Fourier transformed
image by using ”fftshift” function. After that, we will calculate the magnitude spectrum
and finally, we will center the magnitude spectrum.


I created more than 4 filters to understand the effect of Fourier transformation on an
image. I created these filters arbitrarily and it doesn’t matter. The important is to
visualize the effect of transformation on the image. As I said I created these filters
arbitrarily that’s why I will name them filter1, filter2, filter3, and so on.


In the end, after seeing all the plots I can conclude that Fourier transform is an incredible
tool in image processing. The main advantage of Fourier transform is that we can apply
filters in the frequency domain. In the next report, we will try to implement Fourier
transformation from scratch.
